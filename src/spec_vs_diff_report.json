  "summary": "AppShell header was updated to render a centered, desktop-only navigation set (including “Chat” and “Events”) gated by an authenticated+onboarded check, with active-route styling. The change also appears to introduce additional header links (e.g., My Profile/Admin) and may inadvertently hide public navigation items for unauthenticated/unonboarded users on desktop due to the top-level gating of the nav.",

      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "On mobile (sm and below), users can still navigate via the existing bottom navigation behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated before showing the mobile/bottom navigation portion of AppShell, so it cannot be verified from the provided evidence that the existing bottom navigation remains present/unchanged on small screens.",

      "reason": "The entire desktop nav block is wrapped in `{canAccessCommunity && (...)}`, which prevents rendering any header nav items for unauthenticated/unonboarded users, even though `navItems` includes `public: true` entries.",
