  "summary": "The diff largely implements non-blocking initialization and adds watchdog-driven, user-visible fallback states to prevent indefinite full-screen loading. A new safe actor hook avoids awaiting potentially hanging admin initialization. However, there are some UI/content additions (e.g., points/bonus messaging) that appear unrelated to the loading/initial-render fix and may exceed the stated non-goals.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/expanded profile “Points Summary” UI and bonus/points completion messaging, which is not requested as part of fixing the infinite-loading/initial-render issue.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly say not to add new features beyond fixing loading/initial-render. The diff shows new UI sections and messaging on the profile page that go beyond initialization fault-tolerance and error/slow fallbacks.",
