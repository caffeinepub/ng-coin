Ensure active-route highlighting works for `/admin?tab=profiles` by leveraging the existing admin+tab matching logic in `isActiveRoute`, and confirm it renders in both desktop navigation and the mobile sheet menu via the existing `visibleMenuItems` mapping. Keep all labels in English and do not modify any files under `frontend/src/components/ui`."
