  "summary": "The diff clearly adds an admin-only menu item labeled \"Profile Management\" that links to /admin with a search param tab=profiles in AppShell.tsx. However, because AppShell.tsx is truncated before the active-route logic and before the rendered desktop/mobile menus, the diff summary does not provide enough evidence to confirm that active highlighting works specifically for /admin?tab=profiles or that the entry appears in both desktop navigation and the mobile sheet menu.",

      "requirement": "The \"Profile Management\" entry must appear in both the desktop navigation and the mobile sheet menu.",
