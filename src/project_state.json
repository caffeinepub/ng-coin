  "summary": "Build an Internet Computer (ICP) application called “NG COIN” (using Caffeine) for a community-driven impact project: Internet Identity auth, strict admin/user roles, onboarding, private+public user profiles with admin validation, points system, community live chat/guestbook, events with RSVP and counters, partners page, and a private admin dashboard; data stored on ICP canisters with strict access controls.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend separated from backend; single backend canister for logic/data (initially).",
    "Authentication via Internet Identity; enforce permissions in every backend method (admin vs user).",
    "Persist application state in stable variables; validate inputs before writes.",
    "Admin identified by a specific ICP Principal ID; admin-only routes/methods must be strictly protected.",
    "Add a per-user account visibility setting (Public vs Private) and enforce it in backend queries that expose public profiles and in frontend navigation/directory visibility.",
    "Navigation requirement: provide clickable menu entries for all available feature pages, with visibility controlled by auth/onboarding/admin gating so every permitted function is reachable from the UI."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "User reports admin dashboard, event creation, and live chat are not visible after login; likely admin principal not configured/recognized and/or feature visibility gated by onboarding/auth state.",
    "Even when logging in with the intended admin identity, the user cannot see any navigation links to reach onboarding or access the gated menus; onboarding/menu entrypoint may be missing or hidden due to gating logic.",
    "App gets stuck in an infinite loading state before rendering any UI (user cannot see/login to access menus); likely an auth/session initialization, routing, or canister call hang that blocks initial render.",
    "After deployment (v7), app shows \"Initialization Error: Failed to load your profile. You can still browse public pages\" indicating profile-loading failure during auth/initialization.",
    "Deployment/build to the network failed; requires retry and investigation of deployment error if it persists."
